- Here I demonstrate a use case of API to download images from the web.
- The website is https://unsplash.com/
- Its API is https://unsplash.com/documentation
- Goal: Download images by search query and date of image/photo creation. 
- In 'apiDownloadImages.ipynb' I wrote scripts to make http requests on images, filtered
by search query and range of date.
    - Running the script in this notebook downloads 10 images of 'black lives matter' protests
    created between 2020/May to 2020/December.
